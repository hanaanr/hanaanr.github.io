I'm an interdisciplinary, versatile analyst-human driven by responsibility, transparency and accountability in tech. Firm advocate for privacy, free software, and open source.

I've built experience analyzing web privacy policy readability, investigating torrent privacy risks, and optimizing AI infrastructure for civic tech. I'm a data analyst, researcher, manager ~  fluid in the interstices, jack of all trades, a happy generalist.

I'm in the trade of using the tools at our disposal to prod at opaque big tech entities that prefer to stay opaque.
