I'm driven by responsibility, transparency and accountability in tech. 

I've worked on web privacy policy analysis, decentralized data protection, and AI infrastructure and accessibility for civic tech. I've been a researcher, manager, and data analyst - primarily working in the public interest space. 

I'm passionate about privacy, free software and open-source, and I enjoy prodding at opaque tech entities that prefer to stay opaque. 

Funnily enough, I trained as a physicist, and I find that it helps me approach closed systems with healthy skepticism.
