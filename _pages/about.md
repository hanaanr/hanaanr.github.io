I'm driven by responsibility, transparency and accountability in tech. 

I've worked on analyzing web privacy policy readability, supporting community-led data protection, and optimizing AI infrastructure for civic tech. Broadly speaking, I am a technologist. I've been a data analyst, researcher, manager ~ primarily working on projects in the public and/or non-profit and/or public interest tech start-up space. 

I'm passionate about privacy, free software and open-source. I believe in using these tools at our disposal to prod at opaque tech entities that prefer to stay opaque.
