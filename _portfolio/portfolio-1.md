Analyzed 100,000+ privacy policies across two decades to expose a critical barrier to informed consent: **most require college-level reading skills**, with complexity increasing over time.

Using statistical modeling on the Princeton-Leuven Longitudinal Corpus, uncovered a counterintuitive pattern. Data-intensive industries (social media, advertising) maintain *slightly* more readable policies than other sectors, though all remain inaccessible to average users.

Technical complexity in legal documents can systematically undermine users' ability to make informed decisions about their data.
