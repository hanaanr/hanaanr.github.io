Researched AI (LLM) infrastructure for Agora Citizen Network, a privacy-conscious, open-source platform for depolarizing political discussions. Provided cost-performance analysis to help the team make informed technical decisions within budget constraints.​

Improved how the platform communicates complex civic discussions to users. Tested different AI models and refined prompts to make community deliberations clearer and more accessible (with summaries, topics, labels), helping citizens understand where people agree and disagree on divisive issues.
