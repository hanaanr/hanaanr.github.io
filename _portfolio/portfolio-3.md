Researched AI (LLM) infrastructure for the Agora Citizen Network, a privacy-conscious, open-source platform for depolarizing political discussions. Conducted cost-performance analysis to help the team make informed technical decisions within budget constraints.​

Improved how the platform communicates complex civic discussions to users. Tested different AI models and refined prompts to make community deliberations clearer and more accessible (with summaries, topics, labels), helping citizens understand where people agree and disagree on divisive issues.

The screenshot below shows an example of opinion clusters, based on the [Pol.is](https://compdemocracy.org/) algorithm (maintained by the Computational Democracy Project). My work involved implementing LLM-generated text elements, such as summaries, group labels and topics.
