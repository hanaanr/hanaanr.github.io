Building a DuckDB extension that enables decentralized preservation of at-risk datasets through BitTorrent protocols. The tool removes single points of failure and corporate control, allowing communities to independently preserve and query critical climate, health, and environmental data with built-in integrity verification.

This project started during the Equitech Futures' People's Data Stewardship Hackathon, which focused on community-centered approaches to data governance and stewardship.
