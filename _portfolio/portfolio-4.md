Co-built a data dashboard for Kenyan government officials and consultants managing public water infrastructure. Helped make complex infrastructure data accessible to decision-makers working in regulation and resource allocation in a sector facing significant transparency challenges.​

Wrote documentation and stakeholder briefings translating statistical findings into policy recommendations. Bridged technical analysis and government implementation, turning data into something officials could actually use, while addressing an important public accountability challenge.
